So, you have created a useful, customisable, modular component in REACT. Now, you want to share it with everyone by making a package so that anyone can install it ? That is exactly what I had done and now I also wanted to create a npm package and publish it and this is how I did it.

## Prerequisites

Since I was going to create a npm package, I needed to have Node and npm installed on my system.

Also I needed a npm account. I didn't have one so I had to create one before I got started. You can also create one from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Getting Started

First order of business was to select an unique name for my package. I settled on `react-rails-pagination` as the name for my package.

To confirm that no package with the same name existed I had to use the following command.

{% highlight shell %}
npm search react-rails-pagination
{% endhighlight %}

You can use
{% highlight shell %}
npm search <your-package-name>
{% endhighlight %}
And if no existing package is found with the same name, then you are good to go.

After I selected a package name, I had to run the following command in my terminal to initialise the package.

{% highlight shell %}
npx create-react-library react-rails-pagination
{% endhighlight %}
I was prompted to answer a few questions about my package now

![npm package basic info]({{site.baseurl}}/images/creating-an-npm-package-from-my-react-component/package-info.png)

After entering all the information, it will automatically setup the project. This process might take a little time.

The advantage of using `create-react-library` is that it will initialise your project to be published along with an example where you can test your package. It will also initialise it as a local git repository which you can simply push to github after adding the URL for your remote repository.

After `create-react-library` finishes, the folder structure looks like this

![npm package file structure]({{site.baseurl}}/images/creating-an-npm-package-from-my-react-component/file-structure.png)

I had to run the following commands in two different terminal tabs to start the development environment

{% highlight shell %}
cd react-rails-pagination && npm start
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight shell %}
cd react-rails-pagination/example && npm start
{% endhighlight %}
The first command watches the `src/` and recompiles it into the `dist/` folder when you make changes.

The second command runs the example app that links to your package.

## Adding my REACT Component

Now, I had a look inside the `src/` folder in my project. There was an `index.js` file which held an `ExampleComponent` that was being used in the example app.

To add my own REACT Component, I placed my `Pagination.jsx` file that held my Pagination component inside the `src/` folder. Since, my component required a css file too, I placed my css file `index.css` inside the same folder as well. I import this `index.css` file inside my Pagination component.

I don't use a separate css module in my component so I deleted the generated `styles.modules.css` file inside the src directory.

After I had done these changes, my src directory looked something like this

![npm package src folder structure]({{site.baseurl}}/images/creating-an-npm-package-from-my-react-component/src-structure.png)

Now, I need to make sure that my component is being exported from this package, so that any project that uses my package, will get to use my component as well.

For this I have to make some changes to the `index.js` file.

{% highlight js %}
import Pagination from './Pagination';

export default Pagination;
{% endhighlight %}

This imports my component into the `index.js` file and sets it as the default export from the package. I do this because the source file or the entrypoint of my package is the `src/index.js` file.

If you don't want to use the `index.js` file or want to create a new entrypoint then open the `package.json` file in the root of the project and change the value of the `source` key in that file.

This completes the process of adding my component to the package.

## Checking if my package is working as expected

To check if my package is working or not, I have to go to the `example/` folder.

In that folder, I have to edit the `App.js` file which imports the `ExampleComponent` that I modified earlier to use my `Pagination` component.

{% highlight js %}
import React from 'react'

import Pagination from 'react-rails-pagination'
import 'react-rails-pagination/dist/index.css'

const App = () => {
  let page = 1;
  const totalPages = 5;

  const handleChangePage = (currentPage) => {
    page = currentPage;
  }
  return <Pagination page={page} pages={totalPages} handleChangePage={handleChangePage} />
}

export default App;
{% endhighlight %}

These changes allow me to import my package into this example application and check if it is working or not.

Now if I open the address that the local development server is running on in my browser, I can see that my component is loaded and functioning now.

## Publishing my package

I need to add a few things to get this package ready for publishing.

First I add a `.npmignore` file to stop a few things from being included in my published package to reduce it's size. It works the same as a `.gitignore` file but for npm in this case.

The `.npmignore` looks like this in my project

{% highlight shell %}
## the src folder
src
.babelrc
rollup.config.js
## node modules folder
node_modules
## git repository related files
.git
.gitignore
CVS
.svn
.hg
.lock-wscript
.wafpickle-N
.DS_Store
npm-debug.log
.npmrc
#others
config.gypi
package-lock.json
{% endhighlight %}
Next I opened the `package.json` and added a few things in there as well.
{% highlight json %}
{
  "name": "react-rails-pagination",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "React Pagination Component for Rails and other MVC Frameworks",
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": "piyushswain/react-rails-pagination",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "module": "dist/index.modern.js",
  "source": "src/index.js",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=10"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "react",
    "rails",
    "mvc",
    "react-component",
    "pagination"
  ],
  "author": {
    "name": "Piyush Swain",
    "email": "piyush.swain3@gmail.com"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/piyushswain/react-rails-pagination",
  .
  .
  .
  .
}
{% endhighlight %}

I updated the `author` field to add my email.

Next, I added the keys `homepage` and `keywords`.

`homepage` can be used to add a website link to your project. I used my github repository link for now but I will change it later when I add a demo to this project. If you have a working demo, you can add that link in it's place.

The `keywords` key can be used to give the npm search directory keywords to attach to your project so that people using the npm search engine can find your project more easily. It takes an array of words as an argument.

Finally, I update the `README.md` file in the root directory to add a description and instructions for anyone using my package. You will have to update your `README.md` according to your package as well.

I review all the changes and then first push my code to my github repository.

{% highlight shell %}
git remote add origin https://github.com/piyushswain/react-rails-pagination.git # Sets the new remote for the local repo
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
git push -u origin main  # Pushes the changes to the remote repository
{% endhighlight %}

Now, my package is ready to be published. I run the following commands to start the process of publishing my package to npm.

{% highlight shell %}
npm login
{% endhighlight %}
Login command asks for the username and password of your npm account. Enter those succeessfully and it will log you in to npm. If you have already logged in to npm, then you can skip this step.

{% highlight shell %}
npm run build
{% endhighlight %}
This optimizes and creates a production build for your package. I recommend running this everytime before you issue a publish command.

{% highlight shell %}
npm publish
{% endhighlight %}
Finally, running this command will upload your package to npm. You can check it in your npm profile where you can find all your uploaded packages.

If you wish to publish again after making some changes then open your `package.json` file and update the `version` key to publish again. Remember to build your package before publishing as it will create an optimized production build for your package.

**TIP:** If for some reason you cannot get the `css` to work, then a small hack is to directly update the `dist/index.css` file as this is the file that is published and used by anyone importing your package
