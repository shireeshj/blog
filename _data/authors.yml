   bio: "Shireesh heads technology at eLitmus. He is generally curious about things, especially technology.
      His curiosity almost cost him his first job when he hacked into a customer's system to gain unauthorized internet 
      access (mid '90s). He was lucky, his employer saw this as a potential rather than a threat."
