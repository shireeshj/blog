<strong>Why eLitmus technology team?</strong>
<ol>
<li>We don't hire ninja's, because we do not know how to evaluate them. Apparently you know someone is a ninja only after s/he has killed you...</li>
<li> But we love and hire nerds. </li>
<li>eLitmus was founded by a bunch of technocrats. Technology had to be the backbone of our business, and it is. If you are a nerd, we are the employer you are looking for.</li>
<li>After 16 years of classroom education, if you wish to spend another six months locked up in a fancy classroom somewhere in Mysore or Chennai, we are definitely NOT the employer for you.
Instead, if you get your kicks out of seeing your code used by thousands of people within the first week of your employment, Come talk to us... </li>
